A named list with at least 3 slots: \describe{
\item{genotypes}{A \link[bigstatsr:FBM.code256-class]{FBM.code256} which is
a special Filebacked Big Matrix encoded with type \code{raw} (one byte
unsigned integer), representing genotype calls and possibly imputed
allele dosages. Rows are individuals and columns are SNPs.}
\item{fam}{A \code{data.frame} containing some information on the individuals
(read from a ".fam" file).}
\item{map}{A \code{data.frame} giving some information on the variants
(read from a ".bim" file).}
